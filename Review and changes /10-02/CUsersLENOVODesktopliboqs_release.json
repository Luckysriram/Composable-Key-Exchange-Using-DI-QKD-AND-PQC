  "body": "liboqs version 0.14.0\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.  \r\n\r\n**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.  Details about liboqs can be found in [README.md](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/blob/main/README.md).  See in particular limitations on intended use.\r\n\r\nliboqs can be used with the following Open Quantum Safe application integrations:\r\n\r\n- **oqs-provider**: A standalone prototype [OpenSSL 3 provider](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man7/provider.html) enabling liboqs-based quantum-safe and hybrid key authentication and exchange for TLS 1.3, X.509 certificate generation and CMS operations.\r\n- **OQS-BoringSSL**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into TLS 1.3 in our fork of BoringSSL; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/boringssl.\r\n- **OQS-OpenSSH**: A prototype integration of liboqs-based authentication and key exchange into Secure Shell (SSH) version 2 in our fork of OpenSSH; see https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/openssh.\r\n\r\nSeveral [demos](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/oqs-demos) are available for using the above libraries in applications, including Apache, Chromium, curl, haproxy, nginx, and Wireshark.\r\n\r\nliboqs can also be used in the following programming languages via language-specific wrappers:\r\n\r\n- C++, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-cpp\r\n- Go, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-go\r\n- Java, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-java\r\n- Python 3, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python\r\n- Rust, via https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-rust\r\n\r\nRelease notes\r\n=============\r\n\r\nThis is version 0.14.0 of liboqs. It was released on July 10, 2025.\r\n\r\nThis release contains a security fix for secret-dependent branching in HQC. It introduces support for SNOVA, a NIST Additional Signatures Round 2 candidate, and a new optimized implementation of SHA3 using AVX-512VL instructions. Additionally, this is the first liboqs release to include the [stable 1.0.0 version of PQ Code Package's mlkem-native](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/releases/tag/v1.0.0).\r\n\r\nThis release also introduces a number of improvements to testing and infrastructure. The OQS project is now publishing benchmarking data on https://openquantumsafe.org/benchmarking and code coverage data on https://coveralls.io/github/open-quantum-safe/liboqs.\r\n\r\nDeprecation notice\r\n==================\r\n\r\nThis will be the last release of liboqs to include Dilithium (that is, the NIST Round 3 version of Dilithium, prior to its standardization by NIST as ML-DSA in FIPS 204). Applications should switch to ML-DSA (FIPS 204). Please contact us if you have any concerns.\r\n\r\nSecurity issues\r\n===============\r\n\r\n- CVE-2025-52473: Disabled compiler optimizations for HQC to avoid secret-dependent branches. Thank you to Zhenzhi Lai and Zhiyuan Zhang from from the University of Melbourne and the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy for identifying the issue.\r\n\r\nWhat's New\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis release continues from the 0.13.0 release of liboqs.\r\n\r\n### Key encapsulation mechanisms\r\n\r\n- HQC: Disabled compiler optimizations to avoid secret-dependent branching in certain configurations. HQC remains disabled by default.\r\n- ML-KEM: Updated the default ML-KEM implementation to [PQCP's mlkem-native v1.0.0](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/releases/tag/v1.0.0).\r\n\r\n### Digital signature schemes\r\n\r\n- New API: added an API function to check if a signature scheme supports signing with a context string.\r\n- SNOVA: added [SNOVA](https://snova.pqclab.org/) from NIST Additional Signature Schemes Round 2.\r\n\r\n### Other changes\r\n\r\n- Added an AVX512VL-optimized backend for SHA3.\r\n- Improved memory management throughout the codebase.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDetailed changelog\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Switch to dev mode after 0.13.0 release by @praveksharma in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2125\r\n* Restrict -Wno-maybe-uninitialized to GCC and fix stack size typo by @alraddady in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2111\r\n* Promote @SWilson4 from Committer to Maintainer [skip ci] by @SWilson4 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2120\r\n* Update Nix flake inputs by @aidenfoxivey in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2126\r\n* Change cuPQC upstream repo by @praveksharma in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2115\r\n* Integrate SNOVA into liboqs by @vacuas in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2109\r\n* Update ACVP vectors to latest release by @abhinav-thales in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2131\r\n* Add a function to check if context string is supported by @M-AlNoaimi in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2142\r\n* Skip failing CI test by @dstebila in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2157\r\n* Use OQS_MEM_cleanse() instead of memset() by @Hussain1811 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2158\r\n* Check for NULL dereference before using secure free by @Hussain1811 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2151\r\n* Update mlkem-native to v1.0.0 by @mkannwischer in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2146\r\n* test: Use secure free for freeing secret key objects by @Hussain1811 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2149\r\n* tests: Remove unused variables by @Hussain1811 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2152\r\n* Wycheproof by @h2parson in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2145\r\n* tests: Check OQS_STATUS of RNG and fstore functions by @Hussain1811 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2153\r\n* Adjust constant-time test exception for mlkem-native by @mkannwischer in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2162\r\n* Continuous Benchmarking using Github Actions by @pablo-gf in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2134\r\n* test: Add basic kem fuzz testing by @nathaniel-brough in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2133\r\n* Increase alert threshold for continuous benchmarking by @pablo-gf in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2166\r\n* Benchmarking comments only on alerts by @dstebila in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2168\r\n* Adding code coverage by @aidenfoxivey in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2148\r\n* Add AVX512VL-Optimized SHA3/SHAKE Implementations by @mdcornu in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2167\r\n* Zeroize memory in SHA3 implementation by @aidenfoxivey in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2171\r\n* Disable compiler optimizations for HQC by @SWilson4 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/commit/4215362acbf69b88fe1777c4c052f154e29f9897\r\n* liboqs 0.14.0 release candidate 1 by @SWilson4 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2180\r\n* Document public / internal API split [skip ci] by @SWilson4 in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2182\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @alraddady made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2111\r\n* @vacuas made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2109\r\n* @M-AlNoaimi made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2142\r\n* @Hussain1811 made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2158\r\n* @h2parson made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2145\r\n* @mdcornu made their first contribution in https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/pull/2167\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/compare/0.13.0...0.14.0",
